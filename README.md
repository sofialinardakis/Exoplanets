# Exoplanets
Predicting model for exoplanets using naive bayes &amp; random forest classifiers




Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is not commonly used in astrophysics but still can be used for classifying astronomical objects, classifying radio wave sources and identifying exoplanets. Cannot deal with complexity

classifier with exoplanet dataset, using gaussian naive bayes and random forest, they both did well but random forest had higher accuracy than naive bayes, however naive bayes did exceed my expectations since its accuracy was about 75%
